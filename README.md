The Capacity Exchange (CapX) is a project focusing on [Global Approaches to Local Skills Development](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Movement_Strategy/Initiatives/Global_Approach_for_Local_Skill_Development) within and for the Wikimedia Movement. It establishes a sociotechnical platform for peer-to-peer connection and knowledge sharing to sustainably enable community-based capacity-building.

The aim is to create a methodology and service, which will serve as the structure for initiating mutual skills development globally, regionally, and locally. An interactive, online platform, backed by a database, will enable wikimedians to publish information about themselves, their affiliates, and informal groups. They will also be able to conduct searches, access information and to connect with each other in a way that reflects the Wiki's spirit and the Wikimedia Movement Strategy.

The Capacity Exchange (CapX) is available in Toolforge at https://capacity-exchange.toolforge.org
